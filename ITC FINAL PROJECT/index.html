            <div class="about-me-text">
                <p>I am Tristan Allen C. Cabral, a first-year computer science student passionate about technology and problem-solving. I enjoy exploring programming, developing creative solutions, and continuously learning to expand my skills. My goal is to grow as a versatile and resourceful individual in the tech field.</p>
                <p>The twelfth goal of the United Nationsâ€™ 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is <strong>Responsible Consumption and Production</strong>, which aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. This goal focuses on minimizing the environmental impact of consumption while promoting responsible use of resources across industries.</p>
                <p>Responsible consumption and production are essential to combatting environmental degradation. By adopting more sustainable production methods, reducing waste, and encouraging recycling, we can make a significant impact in addressing climate change, reducing pollution, and preserving ecosystems.</p>
                <p>Achieving this goal requires changes in how we design, produce, and dispose of products, as well as promoting the use of sustainable practices in industries such as agriculture, fashion, and technology. This is crucial to ensuring a future where resources are used efficiently, and waste is minimized.</p>

                <h1>Project Showcase</h1>
                <h2>Cassava-Starch Based Bioplastic Mulch Films Reinforced with Saba Banana Pseudostem Fibers</h2>
                <p>This project investigates the development of biodegradable bioplastic mulch films as an eco-friendly alternative to conventional plastic mulching materials in agriculture. These bioplastics are composed of cassava starch as the base material and reinforced with fibers extracted from Saba banana pseudostems. The research aligns with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) by addressing issues such as plastic pollution and soil health degradation.</p>
                <h3>Features and Highlights:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Biodegradability:</strong> The bioplastic films decompose naturally without leaving harmful residues, reducing long-term environmental impact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Moisture Retention:</strong> Enhances soil moisture conservation for improved plant growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Temperature Regulation:</strong> Maintains optimal soil temperatures suitable for crop production.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reinforcement with Natural Fibers:</strong> Integrates banana pseudostem fibers to improve tensile strength and reduce combustibility.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Benefits:</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Offers a sustainable alternative to traditional polyethylene mulch.</li>
                <li>Reduces dependency on synthetic chemicals for agriculture.</li>
                <li>Enhances soil quality while mitigating waste generation from single-use plastics.</li>
